🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their personal and travel information (age, sex, class, etc.). This project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to solve the Kaggle Titanic challenge.

🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. This is a binary classification problem where:

1 = Survived

0 = Did not survive
